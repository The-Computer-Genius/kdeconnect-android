To upload translations to the Play Store, run from the root of the repo:

```
fastlane supply --skip_upload_screenshots --skip_upload_images --skip_upload_changelogs --json-key <path to the json key file>
```

F-Droid reads them directly from this directory for each release tag, so no action is needed.
